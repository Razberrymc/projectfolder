      <p>By Michael Clark</p>

      <p>The effect of creating an intense bond through the medium of music is deeply rooted within the human mind. When people who share the drive to create come together, they can take their abilities and combine them to create something beautiful. However, what is so special about this phenomena is that no two connections you make with someone will be exactly the same—the chemistry shared with someone, how they feel, their history, their talent, the practice both people have put into singing—is what makes it so unique. The music may be notes on paper but the unique harmony singers create produces the true display of passion. These tips and tricks will help you practice good singing habits, so that you can be the best singer possible.</p>

      <p>Your vocal chords need to stay hydrated, but that doesn't mean you can drink water right before singing and be perfect. Drinking water throughout the day is the best way to keep your throat and mouth performance ready.</p>

      <h2>Breathing</h2>

      <p>Without proper breath support, you will not have the air to sustain holding out notes for very long. The key is to breathe deeply from your lower lungs while keeping your shoulders relaxed. By applying proper breathing technique you will find that hitting difficult notes are a little easier, provided they are within your range.</p>
